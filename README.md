# HawatelPS

## Summary
**HawatelPS** (hawatel_ps) is a Ruby gem for retrieving information about **running processes**. It is easy to use, and you can get useful information about a process. You can `terminate`, `suspend`, `resume` and check the `status` of the process on Linux platform. On Windows platform, you can `terminate` and check the current `status` of the process.

* On Linux platform, the HawatelPS collects all information from pseudo-file system /proc, and it is **free from any gem dependencies**.
* On Windows platform the HawatelPS collects all information from WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation), and it is **free from any gem dependencies**.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hawatel_ps'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hawatel_ps

## Example usage
###### Find process with specified PID
```ruby
process = HawatelPS.search_by_pid(123)
p process.name if !process.nil?
```
###### Get list all running processes
```ruby
processes = HawatelPS.proc_table
```
###### Find processes which matching a certain name
``` ruby
processes = HawatelPS.search_by_name('ruby')
processes.each do |process|
  p "PID: #{process.pid}"
end
```
###### Find processes where vmsize attribute is equal or greater than 2000 kb
```ruby
processes = HawatelPS.search_by_condition(attr => 'vmsize', oper => '>=', value => '2000')
processes.each do |process|
  p process.pid
end
```
###### Suspend processes which name matching with regular expression
``` ruby
processes = HawatelPS.search_by_name('/^ruby/')
processes.each do |process|
  p process.suspend
end
```
###### Resume stopped processes
``` ruby
processes = HawatelPS.search_by_condition(attr => 'state', oper => '==', value => 'stopped')
processes.each do |process|
  p process.resume
end
```
###### Terminate processes which using more that 60% CPU
``` ruby
processes = HawatelPS.search_by_condition(attr => 'cpu_percent', oper => '>', value => '60')
processes.each do |process|
  p process.terminate
end
```
